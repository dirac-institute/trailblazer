class FitsProcessor(UploadProcessor):
    """Suppports processing of a single FITS file.

    An upload is determined to be a FITS file if its extensions ends on one
    of the allowed extensions found in `extensions`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    uploadInfo : `uploads.model.UploadInfo`
        Object containing the time and date of upload and originating IP.
    uploadedFile : `upload_wrapper.temporaryUploadedFileWrapper`
        Uploaded file.

    Attributes
    ----------
    hdulist : `astropy.io.fits.HDUList`
        All HDUs found in the FITS file
    primary : `astropy.io.fits.PrimaryHDU`
        The primary header, a single HDU from hdulist identifying itself as
        the primary header.
    standardizer : `upload.HeaderStandardizer`
        The header standardizer that identified itself as capable of
        standardizing the primary header.
    isMultiExt : `bool`
        True when the FITS file has a multi extension header.

    Notes
    -----
    It is not recommended to use the standardizer's methods directly. Instead
    use their counterparts from processors.

    The standardizer operates, most often, on the primary HDU which usually
    containts all of the required metadata. For some multi-extension headers,
    however, usually the WCS data is contextualized via the primary HDU and
    primary HDU itself does not contain all the data required. It is the
    perogative of the processors to pick which additional HDUs are needed and
    to run the standardizers in the appropriate context. Shortcutting this
    process can, therefore, result in unexpected results or errors.
